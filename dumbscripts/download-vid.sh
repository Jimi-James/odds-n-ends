# Wrapper for youtube-dl to make video downloading easier for me, and
# eliminate the need of a browser to get to the video wherever possible.

# About half of the credit for this file goes to my brother, John Bove

# You have to run it with the --terminal option to make it not open up
# in a new terminal window. Why? Because I like to use YT2Player on
# Firefox to click on a Youtube video and immediately get a terminal
# window of youtube-dl downloading it.
# I suggest making a script called /usr/local/bin/video-dl that runs
# this script with the --terminal option.

# The other options are, you guessed it, the URL of the video, any extra
# folder inside of the destination you want it stored in (good for
# using the playlist feature to download a whole season), and any extra
# options to send straight to youtube-dl.

# Another feature is youtube annotations: it uses youtube-ass
# (https://github.com/nirbheek/youtube-ass) to get a .ass subtitle of
# the annotations and, if there are any annotations, saves the file
# with the same name as the video (otherwise deletes the file).

# Bonus feature: type "dailyshow" as the URL argument to automatically
# get the newest episode of the Daily Show with Trevor Noah. I wish I
# could do that with other shows as easily.
# That hasn't been working lately, because Comedy Central changed their
# site and doesn't update that redirect-to-newest-episode URL until at
# least 24 hours after the episode is available to stream.

# If you, like my brother, have a crippling monthly bandwidth limit, you
# can put the MAC address of your router in $LOWBAND to automatically
# download videos in 360p when you're home, and go for HD otherwise.
# That feature requiresÂ my mac-address.sh script and arping (from the
# package iputils) to be automatic. Otherwise, you can modify the script
# to just always download in 360p.
# Supported sites for automatic 360p are in that if-statement.
# Also can do automatic 720p with MEDBAND.
