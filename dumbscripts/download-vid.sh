# Wrapper for youtube-dl to make video downloading easier for me, and
# eliminate the need of a browser to get to the video wherever possible.

# About half of the credit for this file goes to my brother, John Bove

# You have to run it with the --terminal option to make it not open up
# in a new terminal window. Why? Because I like to use YT2Player on
# Firefox to click on a Youtube video and immediately get a terminal
# window of youtube-dl downloading it.
# I suggest making a script called /usr/local/bin/video-dl that runs
# this script with the --terminal option.

# The other options are, you guessed it, the URL of the video, any extra
# folder inside of the destination you want it stored in (good for
# using the playlist feature to download a whole season), and any extra
# options to send straight to youtube-dl. Other options include a
# compatibility check and telling the script to ask you how you want to
# handle the link. The proper order of the options goes:

# USAGE: download-vid.sh [--terminal|(--compatible)] (--compatible) URL
# [[destination subfolder]] [--ask] [extra options for youtube-dl]
# My own made-up usage notation:
# (parentheses) mean the argument is optional AND renders all of the
# optional arguments that come after it moot and useless.
# [[double brackets]] mean the argument is optional UNLESS you want to
# include the arguments that come after it. So, for the subfolder
# option, if you want to include extra options for youtube-dl, but don't
# want to specify a subfolder, you'll have to put a "./" in as its
# argument.

# Another feature is youtube annotations: it uses youtube-ass
# (https://github.com/nirbheek/youtube-ass) to get a .ass subtitle of
# the annotations and, if there are any annotations, saves the file
# with the same name as the video (otherwise deletes the file).

# Bonus feature: type "dailyshow" as the URL argument to automatically
# get the newest episode of the Daily Show with Trevor Noah. I wish I
# could do that with other shows as easily.
# That hasn't been working lately, because Comedy Central changed their
# site and doesn't update that redirect-to-newest-episode URL until at
# least 24 hours after the episode is available to stream.

# Now has integration with browser.sh to automatically open video links
# that are compatible with this script according to YOUR choice at the
# time! Download, browser, or video player.

# Now also integrates with a new script, queue-dl, that queues up video
# downloads instead of downloading them all at once. For me,
# /usr/local/bin/queue-dl is a symlink to
# $HOME/.dumbscripts/download-vid-queue.sh, which is now a file in this
# git repo.

# Another new feature: if you feed it a text file with URLs separated by
# whitespace instead of a single URL, it will download each of those
# URLs in order, using queue-dl to (annoyingly) pop up a download window
# for each one. Currently not working.

# If you, like my brother, have a crippling monthly bandwidth limit, you
# can put the MAC address of your router in $LOWBAND to automatically
# download videos in 360p when you're home, and go for HD otherwise.
# That feature requiresÂ my mac-address.sh script and arping (from the
# package iputils) to be automatic. Otherwise, you can modify the script
# to just always download in 360p.
# Supported sites for automatic 360p are in that if-statement.
# Also can do automatic 720p with MEDBAND.

# New feature: backs up a list of your downloaded videos so that getting
# them back isn't a nightmare if your hard drive dies before you back it
# up.
