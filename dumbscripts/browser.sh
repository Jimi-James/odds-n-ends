#!/bin/bash

# My default browser script. This script does a number of things:
# 1. Parse links to get rid of URL redirects, automatically convert
# HTML character codes (like http%2A%3F%3F turns into http://), and open
# known files in your program of choice using a Bash 4 hash
# 2. Automatically open all links on ONE computer in the network, the
# designated "ROUTER". So, if you click a link from your laptop and your
# default browser is set to this script, it'll open that link in your
# "ROUTER", or in my case, my desktop, according to what you've set in
# the files it draws all that info from. As a bonus, it's smart enough
# to open the link in that laptop if the "ROUTER" is not accessible, or
# if it doesn't have a Logitech mouse plugged in. That's great for if
# you have a KVM switch and don't want to open links in a desktop whose
# mouse & keyboard are currently plugged into another computer.
# 3. Double-click proof. If the same link is opened multiple times at
# once, it'll notice that and only open it once. I added that because of
# a bug where Rambox (the chat program) opens links 4-6 times at once.
# It's not perfect, because there's no way to ensure that this script
# DEFINITELY won't have 2 or more instances running at the same time.
# Currently, I've reduced what was always 4-6 simultaneous link openings
# to USUALLY 1, ocassionally 2.
# "At once" in this script means within $LOCKTIME seconds.
# WARNING: Feature #3 means there is usually a text file containing the
# last link you opened from outside of a browser. In case you care about
# privacy.
# 4. Remote Usage Mode: This will do more things when I replace my phone
# with a Pyra, but for now, it will automatically open video links with
# video-dl (see my download-vid.sh script) on the main home computer
# (coming soon)
# 5. Coming soon: a switch, that you can make into a desktop shortcut,
# that decides whether the computer will bother with trying to open
# links on the main computer, or go with its own local browser.

# NOTE: Unlike other dumbscripts, this one assumes it lives in
# $HOME/.mydefaults instead of .dumbscripts, to be consistent with the
# freedesktop standards of your default browser being in .mydefaults. I
# just created a symlink:
# $HOME/.mydefaults/browser.sh -> ../.dumbscripts/browser.sh
# Or you could just keep it in .mydefaults. That's fine, too.

# But, Jimi, why make this whole thing when KDE already has a lot of
# these features?
# Because I like XFCE better than KDE, and KDE was super super buggy
# about deciding when to open links in other programs anyway. Or at
# least KDE 4 was. Like there was NO way to automatically open HTML
# files in a text editor while also opening an image file in your image
# viewer. You had to pick one of those. Por qu√© no los dos?
